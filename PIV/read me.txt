First run track_pattern_discretesave_with_thresh.m.

Then use stiching.m to stich the discrete data together. 

Use track_spurious.m to remove spurious data.

Use track_density.m and track_vorticity.m to obtain more information.

Use track_wave_front.m and time_space_evolution to analyze the wave propagation.
